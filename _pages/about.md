# Zhengyi Li

Hi, I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.augustana.edu/academics/areas-of-study/computer-science) at [Augustana College](https://www.augustana.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com). 

My research focuses on data-driven security, specifically the cyber threat intelligence, cybercrime, and privacy enforcement. Recently, I have extended my work to emerging areas such as blockchain security and the security of Large Language Models.
