#Zhengyi Li
======

Hi, I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com). 

My research focuses on critical cybersecurity issues. In general, I am dedicated to gathering Cyber Threat Intelligence, investigating the dynamics of underground marketplaces and their impact on public health. I also work on privacy compliance and enforcement, blockchain security, and the security of machine learning systems.
